A 2D game engine for Android

Welcome to BobEngine! BobEngine is an OpenGL based 2D game engine for Android that aims to simplify and speed up 2D Android game development! It started as a base for my Android game Plane Popper but after finishing my game I went to work generalizing the engine so that it could be reused for future projects. I created it mostly for my own projects, but I decided that I would share it with others.

Support for BobEngine will be limited for now because I am still a student and I'm very busy. However, I will certainly try to put out new examples when I get the time and maybe make some tutorials as well. For now, there are two examples that show the basic structure of a BobEngine game. Template is a bare bone project with just a few basic things to get you started and help you understand the structure of a BobEngine game. TouchInput is based on Template and demonstrates how you can use BobEngine to receive input from the touch screen.

[UPDATE] BobEngine 1.0 Thingama is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

More examples and tutorials are coming soon, as my schedule permits.
